# Project State and Memory

## Current State
- Project is set up with Python virtual environment
- Core SVG rendering functionality is implemented
- Modular design with separate renderers for different schematic elements
- Currently working on feature/explicit-svg-rendering branch
- Integration test plan has been created and needs review

## Core Components

### SVGRenderer
The main class responsible for converting schematic data to SVG format.

#### Key Features:
- Modular design with specialized renderers
- Handles wires, symbols, text, and shapes
- Supports T-junction detection for wire intersections
- Configurable rendering parameters (stroke width, font size, etc.)
- Automatic viewBox calculation with padding
- Symbol data support with transformations

#### Current Implementation:
- Basic rendering pipeline is in place
- Core renderers are implemented
- ViewBox calculation is implemented
- T-junction detection is implemented
- Symbol rendering with transformations is implemented

#### Dependencies:
- svgwrite: For SVG generation
- Custom renderers for different element types

## Integration Testing
- Integration test plan created in `context/integration_test_plan.md`
- Plan includes:
  - Test structure and organization
  - Detailed test categories
  - Comparison methods
  - Test implementation framework
  - Data collection strategy
  - Validation process
  - Success criteria

## Known Issues
1. Need to add unit tests for the new implementation
2. Need to verify symbol rendering with transformations
3. Need to test T-junction detection with various wire configurations

## Next Steps
- Review and refine integration test plan
- Set up test environment
- Create initial test cases
- Implement comparison tools
- Begin testing process
